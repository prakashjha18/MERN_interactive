				<p>
					Millions of people board Airbus airplanes and helicopters each year, from airline passengers to
					military pilots and troops, and each puts their trust in the Airbus brand to deliver them safely to
					destinations around the world. Airbus knows this trust doesn’t come lightly; it was earned – and
					continues to be earned – on the strength of decades of experience, thousands of aircraft in
					operation and millions of flight-hours.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p className="">
					The number one priority at Airbus is the continued safe transport of everyone, and everything, that
					flies aboard an Airbus product – from passengers, cargo, and humanitarian relief supplies on
					aircraft and rotorcraft, to satellite and spacecraft that keep the world connected and explore the
					mysteries of deep space.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p className="">
					Airbus’ dedication to safety is reflected across the company. From design, engineering and
					production to maintenance, training and support, Airbus is committed to exceeding industry safety
					standards and supporting the safe operation of all its aircraft and those that fly aboard them.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					While the foundations of safety are built on regulatory compliance, Airbus goes beyond airworthiness
					requirements to also focus on safety enhancement activities in products, services, customer
					operation, and with international stakeholders, whilst also adapting the organisation to meet
					evolving conditions.
